Insulin Bolus Calculator
This Python script calculates the insulin bolus (dose) required for a meal based on the user's carb ratio, insulin sensitivity factor, target blood glucose level, current blood glucose level, carb intake, and insulin on board (IOB).

Features
User-friendly prompts to input required parameters
Calculation of carb dose and correction dose
Adjustment for insulin on board
Rounding of the final bolus to the nearest 0.5 units
Display of recommended insulin bolus, current blood glucose, and target blood glucose
Saving of results to a CSV file for record-keeping
Usage
Run the main.py script in a Python environment.
Enter the following information when prompted:
Carb ratio (grams of carbs per unit of insulin)
Insulin sensitivity factor (mg/dL per unit)
Target blood glucose level (mg/dL)
Current blood glucose level (mg/dL)
Grams of carbs for the meal
Insulin on board (units)
The script will calculate and display the recommended insulin bolus, current blood glucose, and target blood glucose levels.
The results will be saved to a CSV file in the same directory, with the filename format results_YYYY-MM-DD.csv.
Requirements
Python 3.x
